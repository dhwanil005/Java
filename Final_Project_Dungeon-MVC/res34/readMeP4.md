## 1.About/Overview
We were asked to design a controller for a dungeon game, this project was an extension to the previous one, some model refactoring functionalities were also there, like adding monsters, arrows smell.

## 2.List Of Features
-> Creating a controller for dungeon
-> Allocating Monster.
->Picking up and allocation of arrows.
->Player can shoot Monsters.
-> Player can also be eaten by monsters.

## 3.How To Run Jar file
Open Terminal type java -jar and drag and drop the jar file in the terminal.

## 4.How To Use The Program
Using command line.
## 5. Description Of Examples
I have submitted 2 example run from which the first one shows the player killing the monster and finishing the game, along side with picking treasure and arrows, the second one shows the player getting eaten by the monster and losing the game.

## 6.Design Changes
-> Added controller class.
->Added different methods to the pre-existing classes like dungeon, player.
->Added new class for Arrows.


## 7.Assumptions
->The minimum number of rows and columns can be 3.
->Monsters get randomly assigned in the caves except for the start node.

## 8.Limitations
->Tunnels and caves are not differentiated yet so every node in the dungeon is a cave.
## 9.Citations
->Nothing to cite.
