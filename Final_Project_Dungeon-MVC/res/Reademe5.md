## 1.About/Overview
We were asked to design a View for a Dungeon game, this project was an extension to the previous one, Adding A menu bar and representing the dungeon on the screen were the main requirements.

## 2.List Of Features
-> Creating a View for dungeon
-> Creating GUI Controller for dungeon
-> Player can freely roam in the dungeon,pickup treasure and arrows, shoot monsters and get to the end of the dungeon.
-> Player can shoot with the space key.
-> Player can move with W,A,S,D keys.

## 3.How To Run Jar file
Open Terminal type java -jar and drag and drop the jar file in the terminal.

## 4.How To Use The Program
Using command line.
## 5. Description Of Examples
 I have submitted examples, The first one shows player picking up arrows and treasure, the second one shows player winning and the third one shows player losing by entering the cave with monster, the last one shows the menu for the dungeon game.
## 6.Design Changes
->Added GUI Controller to the design
->Added more classes to ensure the program follows the SOLID principles

## 7.Assumptions
->The minimum number of rows and columns can be 5.
->Monsters get randomly assigned in the caves except for the start node.
-> Player shoots with the space key.
-> Player moves with W,A,S,D keys.

## 8.Limitations
->Images are not added to the dungeon, so the caves color changes as soon as the player enters the cave. Smell level is displayed rather than images.
## 9.Citations
->Nothing to cite.
